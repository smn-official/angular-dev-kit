# DevKit

This library was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.2.7.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name --project dev-kit` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module --project dev-kit`.
> Note: Don't forget to add `--project dev-kit` or else it will be added to the default project in your `angular.json` file. 

## Build

Run `ng build dev-kit` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
